files and ffolder links are available on the network. 
So, use the users encrypted password as a salt to access all their files.
The salt will encode the url, so that in the user folders it will not be 
able to guess the url very easily.
How to:
	User uploads file. 
	Destination path is salted by encrpyted password. and saved in the file table.
		user : ehcrpyted path
	
Required programs:
	sudo, 
	
Sample visudo entries from a Debian based system where the webserver runs as www-data:

User_Alias NDASADMIN=www-data
Cmnd_Alias NDAS=/usr/sbin/ndasadmin,/bin/mount,/bin/umount,/bin/chown

NDASADMIN ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: NDAS

You could add other users to the alias, also by commas and they would also have permission for the tools used in the NDAS commands.
The NDASADMIN line allows anyone in the group to run those programs without asking for a password. 
There are bound to be security risks in this so it is for installer to decide to allow or not.
