A set of scripts in PHP for managing NETDISKs on Linux computers. It 
also provides a minimal use interface for uploading and downloading
to the NETDISKs via the Internet.

NDAS Hardware, such as the NETDISK by IOCELL Networks is used to connect
block devices, to computers via the network.

For more information about NDAS usage please visit us on the web:

The files in this repository only pertain to Linux systems because
of the way the scripts gather information about the drives. 

2012-10-04 History: 
NDAS was created by Ximeta as a proprietary connection system for
Network Direct Attached Storage devices. IOCELL Networks took ownership of
all patents and technology rights to NDAS in 2011. From 2012 the connection
packages are being open sourced. These scripts were originally created
for use on small routers including cgi-bin access. We are going to
implement the same functions all in PHP.
